# Spring Practice Site (Views)

It's a web page where I show the views (implementing Boostrap) that I use in a backend spring project with the same name. In that project I practice the following topics:

* Form Validations
    * Text inputs
    * Check boxes
    * Radio buttons
    * Select inputs
    * Emails
    * Passwords
